    <br>Anywhere you are, I am near
    <br>Anywhere you go, I'll be there
    <br>Anytime you whisper my name
    <br>You'll see
    <br>How every single promise I'll keep
    <br>'Cause what kind of guy would I be
    <br>If I was to leave
    <br>When you need me most?
    <br>What are words
    <br>If you really don't mean them when you say them?
    <br>What are words
    <br>If they're only for good times, then they don't?
    <br>When it's love
    <br>Yeah, you say them out loud
    <br>Those words, they never go away
    <br>They live on, even when we're gone
    <br>And I know an angel was sent
    <br>Just for me and I know I'm meant
    <br>To be where I am
    <br>And I'm gonna be
    <br>Standing right beside her tonight
    <br>And I'm gonna be by your side
    <br>I would never leave
    <br>When she needs me most
    <br>What are words
    <br>If you really don't mean them when you say them?
    <br>What are words
    <br>If they're only for good times, then they don't?
    <br>When it's love
    <br>Yeah, you say them out loud
    <br>Those words, they never go away
    <br>They live on, even when we're gone
    <br>Anywhere you are, I am near
    <br>Anywhere you go, I'll be there
    <br>And I'm gonna be here
    <br>Forever more
    <br>Every single promise I keep
    <br>'Cause what kind of guy would I be
    <br>If I was to leave
    <br>When you need me most?
    <br>I'm forever keeping my angel close

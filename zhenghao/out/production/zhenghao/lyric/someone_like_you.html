Someone Like You - Adele<br>
I heard that you're settled down<br>
That you found a girl and you're married now<br>
I heard that your dreams came true<br>
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you<br>
Old friend' why are you so shy?<br>
Ain't like you to hold back<br>
or hide from the light<br>
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited<br
>But I couldn't stay away' I couldn't fight it<br>
I had hoped you'd see my face<br>
And that you'd be reminded that for me<br>
it isn't over<br>
Never mind' I'll find someone like you<br>
I wish nothing but the best for you' too<br>
Don't forget me' I beg<br>
I remember you said<br>
"Sometimes it lasts in love<br>
But sometimes it hurts instead"<br>
Sometimes it lasts in love<br>
But sometimes it hurts instead' yeah<br>
You know how the time flies<br>
Only yesterday was the time of our lives<br>
We were born and raised in a summer haze<br>
Bound by the surprise of our glory days<br>
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited<br>
But I couldn't stay away' I couldn't fight it<br>
I had hoped you'd see my face<br>
And that you'd be reminded that for me<br>
it isn't over<br>
Never mind' I'll find someone like you<br>
I wish nothing but the best for you' too<br>
Don't forget me' I beg<br>
I remember you said<br>
"Sometimes it lasts in love<br>
But sometimes it hurts instead"<br>
Nothing compares<br>
No worries or cares<br>
Regrets and mistakes' they're memories made<br>
Who would have known how bittersweet<br>
this would taste?<br>
Never mind' I'll find someone like you<br>
I wish nothing but the best for you<br>
Don't forget me' I beg<br>
I remember you said<br>
"Sometimes it lasts in love<br>
But sometimes it hurts instead"<br>
Never mind' I'll find someone like you<br>
I wish nothing but the best for you' too<br>
Don't forget me' I beg<br>
I remember you said<br>
"Sometimes it lasts in love<br>
But sometimes it hurts instead"<br>
Sometimes it lasts in love<br>
But sometimes it hurts instead' yeah<br>
